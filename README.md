# Turbo-Guacamole: Distributed In-Memory Cache Library**

Welcome to Turbo-Guacamole, a high-performance distributed in-memory cache
library written in Rust. This library enables you to build scalable and
efficient caching solutions for your applications, with the flexibility to
operate in both client-server and peer-to-peer modes.

## Overview

Turbo-Guacamole is designed to address the challenges of data consistency and
scalability in distributed systems. By providing a shared cache that can be
accessed by multiple instances, this library helps prevent inconsistencies and
incorrect data from arising when different parts of your system access the same
data.

## Architecture

The Turbo-Guacamole architecture consists of two primary components:

1. **Client**: A Rust library that provides a local in-memory cache for each
   instance, allowing it to store and retrieve data efficiently.
2. **Server**: A long-running process that manages the shared cache, ensuring
   consistency across all connected clients.

## Modes

Turbo-Guacamole currently supports two modes:

1. **Client-Server**: This mode requires a central server to manage the shared
   cache, and each client connects to it for updates.
2. **Peer-to-Peer (Ad-Hoc)**: In this mode, clients connect directly to each
   other, without the need for a central server.

## Features

* **In-Memory Cache**: Turbo-Guacamole provides a fast in-memory cache for
storing and retrieving data.

* **Consistency**: The library ensures that all connected clients have access
to the same consistent data.

* **Scalability**: Turbo-Guacamole is designed to handle large numbers of
concurrent connections and high volumes of data.

## Roadmap

Here are some key milestones on our development roadmap:

1. **Initial Release**: Implement the basic client-server architecture,
   including cache functionality and connection establishment.

2. **Ad-Hoc Mode**: Add support for peer-to-peer communication, allowing
   clients to connect directly to each other without a central server.

3. **TTL (Time-To-Live)**: Introduce Time-To-Live expiration mechanisms for
   cache entries, ensuring that stale data is automatically removed.

4. **Messaging**: Implement messaging protocol for client-server and ad-hoc
   modes, enabling efficient communication between nodes.
